## FMBN PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project involved setting up a simulated office network using Cisco Packet Tracer and exploring Wazuh for security monitoring. The objective was to understand how these tools function, create a virtual environment, and document the process.

## What We Did

- **Installed Cisco Packet Tracer**  
  Used Packet Tracer to simulate network devices and design a LAN topology.

- **Explored Packet Tracer Features**  
  Learned how to configure routers, switches, PCs, and test network connectivity.

- **Installed Wazuh**  
  Downloaded and set up Wazuh on virtualbox to understand its role in security monitoring and threat detection.

- **Created a Virtual Machine**  
  Set up a VM on virtualbox to host Wazuh and simulate a real-world deployment.

- **Studied Wazuh Capabilities**  
  Investigated how Wazuh collects logs, detects intrusions, and supports compliance.

- **Designed a LAN Network Topology**  
  Built a LAN using a two-layer hierarchical model in Packet Tracer, including core and access layers for scalability and manageability.

## What We Learned

- Cisco Packet Tracer is a valuable tool for visualizing and testing network designs before physical implementation.
- Wazuh provides real-time security insights and is effective for monitoring systems and detecting threats.
- Virtual machines are useful for safely testing and deploying security tools.
- Hierarchical network design improves performance, scalability, and ease of management.
